** What is happening here?

- server.js file is running config.js file and app.js file


- What does the config.js file do?
    - "use strict" = defines that JavaScript Globally should be used in "strict mode"
    with declaring "strict mode" you can not use undeclared varaibels.
    - require("dotenv").configure() to get variables from .env file.
    - they use the (.env.template) file because they don't want to use the postgresql
    database which will require an actuall username and password. So without actually
    using the variables set on the .env file they default to "airbnb" database but I 
    don't think they seeded that database approproiately on any cloud platform.
        - Normally what I would do is install mongo in my local device and use that
        as a database for working.
