** What is happening here?

- server.js file is running config.js file and app.js file


- what does the app.js file do?
    - It sets up routes for users, listings, and transactions
    - It has a routes set up for auth/ and security/ (security confuses me a little)
    - It uses two middleware functions for error handling
        - 404 error server was not able to find the page
        - 500 error = generic error message, something went wrong with the websites 
        server, but can't specify the problem.


- What does the config.js file do?
    - "use strict" = defines that JavaScript Globally should be used in "strict mode"
    with declaring "strict mode" you can not use undeclared varaibels.
    - require("dotenv").configure() to get variables from .env file.
    - they use the (.env.template) file because they don't want to use the postgresql
    database which will require an actuall username and password. So without actually
    using the variables set on the .env file they default to "airbnb" database but I 
    don't think they seeded that database approproiately on any cloud platform.
        - Normally what I would do is install mongo in my local device and use that
        as a database for working.
  

**database
    - storage.js --> npm-lowdb -> small JSON Database for Node, Electron, and the browser
    - using setup() to sync the database.json file as the database

**middleware
    - listings.js and transactions.js checks to see if the user matches the 
    transactions or listings
    - security.js = makes a jwtFrom() function that grabs jwtwebtokens from
    the res then it extracts the user from the token
    - checks if the user is loggedIn, check if authenticated user is an admin or
    if username matches username on route.

**seed.js
