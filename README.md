# AirBnB Clone Express API

This repo holds the backend code for labs 1 and 2 of the Week 4 labs for building an AirBnB Clone
## Dev Setup

Because this application doesn't use a postgres db at the moment, all db transaction are carried out using `lowdb` into a json file.

No setup is necessary other than installing the dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`.

Then execute `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev` to get the backend up and running on port 3001.
